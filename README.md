# droneObjectDetection w/ PyTorch
Attempting to establish a strong foundation for 'Object Detection'.

As of now the the algorithm we will be using to approach this method will be 'YOLO' (You only look once).
I have decided this algorithm is the best option moving forward provided the growing popularity in this model which leads to more documentation,
as well as its strong support on Pytorch and Python, of which is critical given that our training environment 'Isaac Gym' does not support TensorFlow.
